## Unleashed Style Physics v1.9.4
- Classic Sonic slope stand ability set to Generations value
- Modern Sonic short hop adjusted (again)
- Classic Sonic Spin Attack rebound set to Generations value
- misc - 'removed' some more redundant parameter settings
- misc - set more Classic parameters to their Generations values
This will probably be the last update for a little while! I was playtesting and noticed there was an issue with Seaside Hill 1 where Classic Sonic could easily clip into a wall on one route, which prompted this update.

## Unleashed Style Physics v1.9.3
- Chaos Energy gain by Rings set to Unleashed value (0.02)
- Classic Sonic aerial handling adjusted for Metal Sonic fight

## Unleashed Style Physics v1.9.2
- Fixed a White Space Spin Dash parameter not being set properly for Classic Sonic
- Fixed one of Modern Sonic's parameters getting set to Classic Sonic's value

## Unleashed Style Physics v1.9.1
- Classic Sonic handling based (mostly) on Generations Classic Sonic (again)

## Unleashed Style Physics v1.9
- Modern Sonic Hurdle Jump (short hop) set approximately to Generations final values
- Egg Dragoon fight uses Generations final "WallJumpReady" settings
- Removed all Unleashed Project-related files (would recommend going to the mod folder and deleting the "stages_unleashed" folder if it's still present)
- Classic Sonic handling based on Unleashed Sonic
