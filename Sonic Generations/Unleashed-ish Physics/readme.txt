Before playing, be sure to configure this mod in HedgeModManager. If another mod is modifying the "disk/bb3/#Sonic.ar.00" or "disk/bb3/#SonicClassic.ar.00" files, this mod may not work unless set to higher priority.

The "Homing Attack on Boost" code by SWS90 in HedgeModManager overrides the option set by this mod. The code will also enable the "XButtonHoming" setting for Classic Sonic. This results in him getting a Homing Attack mapped to the Jump button without the actual homing function. If you want to only enable the setting for Modern Sonic, be sure the HMM code is disabled.

Notes for if the Homing Attack is set to the Boost button:

* Control tutorials will still show the Homing Attack as "A + A."

* In the Perfect Chaos battle, you cannot use a Homing Attack on them if you are launched from a spring in a 2D section. However, landing at the bottom of Perfect Chaos will still allow you to attack as you usually would in 3D.

* During the diving section in the Egg Dragoon fight, the Jump button must be used to Homing Attack the boss. The Boost button dives faster as usual.

* You cannot initiate Modern Super Sonic's Floating Boost while in mid-air. He will instead Air Boost / Homing Attack as he would in base form.
