Before playing, be sure to configure this mod in HedgeModManager. If another mod is modifying the "disk/bb3/#Sonic.ar.00" or "disk/bb3/#SonicClassic.ar.00" files, this mod may not work unless set to higher priority.

For instance, if you would like to use these physics with any type of Unleashed Project mod (such as the Unleashed Project Add-On, or Unleashed Encore), I recommend ordering the mods this way in HedgeModManager from top to bottom:

- this mod, with "Modified Stage Files" set to "Disabled"

- Unleashed Project mod

- Unleashed Project 1.0


Some notes for if the Homing Attack is set to the Boost button:

* Control tutorials will still show the Homing Attack as "A + A."

* You cannot use a Homing Attack on Perfect Chaos if you are launched from a spring in a 2D section. However, landing at the bottom of Perfect Chaos will still allow you to attack as you usually would in 3D.

* During the diving section in the Egg Dragoon fight, the Jump button must be used to Homing Attack the boss. The Boost button dives faster as usual.

* You cannot initiate Modern Super Sonic's Floating Boost while in mid-air. He will instead Air Boost / Homing Attack as he would in base form.
