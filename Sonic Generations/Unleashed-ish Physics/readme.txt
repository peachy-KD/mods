Another attempt to bring some Unleashed-styled handling to Generations!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
Before playing, PLEASE be sure to configure this mod in HedgeModManager by right clicking it and selecting "Configure mod!" Having the wrong "Stage Set" configured may cause game-breaking issues!

If another mod is modifying the "disk/bb3/#Sonic.ar.00" or "disk/bb3/#SonicClassic.ar.00" files, this mod may not work unless set to higher priority.

The "Homing Attack on Boost" code by SWS90 in HedgeModManager overrides the option set by this mod. Said code will also enable it for Classic Sonic, resulting in him getting a non-homing air dash mapped to the Jump button. This may make it more difficult to use Elemental Shield actions. If you want to enable the Boost button Homing for only Modern Sonic, be sure to disable the HMM code and set the option within this mod.

Notes for if you set Homing Attack to the Boost button:

* Control tutorials will still show the Homing Attack as "A + A."

* When fighting Perfect Chaos, you cannot use a Homing Attack on them if you are launched from a spring in a 2D section. However, landing at the bottom of Perfect Chaos will still allow you to travel up through them and land a hit as you would in a 3D section.

* During the diving section in the Egg Dragoon fight, the Jump button must be used to Homing Attack the boss. The Boost button dives faster as usual.

* Modern Super Sonic cannot initiate his floating Boost (the "auto-pilot" flight) while in mid-air.
