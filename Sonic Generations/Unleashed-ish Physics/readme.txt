Another attempt to bring some Unleashed styled handling to Generations!

Before playing, be sure to configure this mod in HedgeModManager. If another mod contains the files "disk/bb3/#Sonic.ar.00" or "disk/bb3/#SonicClassic.ar.00", this mod may not work correctly unless set to higher priority.
This mod features:

- player control as accurate as possible to daytime Sonic in Unleashed (within the base systems of Generations);
- play in all Generations missions and bosses without reverting to original physics (most noticeable with Silver and Egg Dragoon);
- choice of Homing Attack button between Jump and Boost for Modern Sonic;
- Modern Sonic rolling on dash panels effectively disabled;
- small adjustments to Classic Sonic's handling (including longer air dash, adjusted air velocity, slightly reduced friction, etc.)


Some notes for if the Homing Attack is set to the Boost button:

- Control tutorials will still show the Homing Attack as "A + A".
- You cannot use a Homing Attack on Perfect Chaos if you are launched from a spring in a 2D section. However, landing at the bottom of Perfect Chaos will still allow you to attack as you usually would in 3D.
- During the diving section in the Egg Dragoon fight, the Jump button must be used to Homing Attack the boss. The Boost button dives faster as usual.
- You cannot initiate Modern Super Sonic's Floating Boost while in mid-air. He will instead Air Boost / Air Dash as he would in base form.
