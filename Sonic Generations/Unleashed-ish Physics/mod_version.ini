String0="Classic Sonic's physics use his Generations final physics as a base rather than Unleashed."
String1="Modern Sonic's wall kick (action done when you Boost while pushing an object) set to the Generations final value. (Gone up to 43.3 from hardcoded value 20; with the old value, the move didn't work consistently)"
String2="Small change: set the default 'Stage Set' option to 'Other' as it will be more ideal for playing other mods; be sure to set it to 'Generations' or 'Unleashed Project 1.0' if playing through those, though!"
