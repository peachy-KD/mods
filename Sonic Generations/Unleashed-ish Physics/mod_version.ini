String0="(Should be the last update for a while!) Reset Water physics to Generations' final since the way I was handling them before was pretty inconsistent and made Classic Sonic too slow. (Below are previous changes)"
String1="1.4 hotfix - Super Sonic jump height restored to Generations final value"
String2="Classic Sonic's physics use his Generations final physics as a base rather than Unleashed."
String3="Modern Sonic's wall kick (action done when you Boost while pushing an object) set to the Generations final value. (Gone up to 43.3 from hardcoded value 20; with the old value, the move didn't work consistently)"
