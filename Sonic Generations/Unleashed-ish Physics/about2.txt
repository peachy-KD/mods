Some other adjustments include:
- acceleration when using High Speed Shoes is faster
- underwater timer uses demo/prototype settings (the "5" of the countdown displays correctly, similarly to other Sonic games)
- underwater gravity and jump handling adjusted
- Modern Sonic - Rocket Wisp charge/launch time uses demo/prototype settings (timing is somewhat similar to Sonic Colors)

For Classic Sonic, the following additional adjustments were made:
- deceleration when Spinning is lower
- sliding (sphere) Spin Dash is faster
- sliding Spin Dash has less friction
- Spin Jump rebound when falling quickly is higher
- Jump Dash travels farther
- air speed adjustments

Most of these parameters were introduced in Sonic Generations, and the settings were changed to what they are by default in the executable for a slightly different experience. Classic Sonic's air speed and Jump Dash were adjusted to be more consistent with what was available in Sonic Unleashed's physics settings. You can turn either Sonic's modded physics off by using the HMM "Configure Mod" menu.
